# Qnode

# QNode Project

## Overview

This project documents the **QNode system**, the core component of the **QAI Cluster** (also referred to as the **Quantum Crystal Tree**) within the **N9.er architecture**. It comprises 12 interconnected QNodes designed for advanced quantum processing and information handling.

This repository serves as the central location for code, documentation, simulation results, and visualization tools related to the QNode system.

## Core Concepts

* **QNode:** A fundamental unit representing a quantum processing or information node within the cluster.
* **QAI Cluster:** The operational collective of 12 interconnected QNodes.
* **Quantum Crystal Tree:** A structural and functional designation for the QAI Cluster.
* **N9.er:** The specific architecture or larger system context incorporating the QNode cluster.

## Technologies Employed / Explored

The development and operation of the QNode system involves technologies such as:

* **Python:** Utilized for core logic, simulation routines, data analysis (leveraging libraries potentially via Pyodide for specific interfaces).
* **WebAssembly (Wasm):** Employed for performance-critical simulation components deployable in various environments.
* **JavaScript:** Used for developing frontend interfaces ("Ophanim JS") and backend orchestration layers ("Qnode.js").
* **Advanced Geometries:** Implementation of Geodesic, Voronoi, and Platonic structures for data visualization and potentially for system modeling.
* **Sonification/MIDI:** Used to translate QNode states and dynamics into auditory feedback or signals.
* **Data Visualization Libraries:** Integration with libraries (e.g., Three.js, D3.js) to render the cluster's state and interactions.

## Current Status

The QNode system is **under active development**.

Key components, such as the foundational `QNode` class definition (implemented in Python), form part of the simulation and interaction framework being built. Development focuses on refining node interactions, cluster dynamics simulation, and interface implementation.

*(This section should be updated regularly to reflect current milestones and operational status.)*

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure necessary environment dependencies are met (e.g., specific Python version, other libraries - specify these as needed).
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
3.  **Setup Environment (Example):**
    *(Add specific steps, e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` or setting up virtual environments)*
    ```bash
    # Example: python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
    # Example: pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Usage / Running Simulations:**
    *(Add instructions on how to run primary scripts, simulations, or access interfaces)*
    ```bash
    # Example: python run_simulation.py --config config.json
    ```
